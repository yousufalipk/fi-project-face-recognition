->Face Recognition Script
This script performs face recognition by comparing a user-provided image against multiple images stored in a folder. It utilizes OpenCV, DeepFace, TensorFlow, and NumPy for accurate facial recognition.

->Installation
pip install opencv-python numpy deepface tensorflow
pip install opencv-python-headless

->How It Works
    1-The script takes an image named "userImage.jpg" from the userImage folder.
    2-It compares this image with multiple images stored in the images folder.
    3-If a match is found, the script recognizes and identifies the face.

->Note
Ensure all the required libraries are installed in your environment before running the script.
